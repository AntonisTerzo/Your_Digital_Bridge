1. Git clone the project.
2. Open Docker Desktop.
3. In the project run: mvn clean package.
4. Then run: docker-compose up --build.

6. Open your browser and go to localhost:8080 to visit the home page.
7. From there navigate to the registration and login page and hopefully you'll enjoy the app.

PS. The app is far from being done. Hopefully i'll have it done soon. :D
